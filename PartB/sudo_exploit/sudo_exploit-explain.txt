Please provide an explanation about how you construct your solution (the program name):


- What value(s) did you overwrite? How did you find them? (subpart1)
4 bytes from 0x805c800

I found the start address of user_details, which is 0x805c800, and printed sizeof(user_details.uid), which is 4. It means uid locates in 0x805c800, 0x805c801, 0x805c802, 0x805c803.


- What value(s) did you overwrite? How did you find them? (subpart2)


- Did you meet the problem that addresses inside/outside GDB are different? Is that a problem or how did you overcome it?

Yes. The absolute addresses are different in GDB and real circumstance, but relative offset is same since the stack are arranged by the same way. I will compute offset used from GDB address first, and modify the original program by adding pfintf to show where the variables are. Assume address from last step is X, usually X+4 is the real address.
